# Power-BI---Pizza-Sales-Analysis
In this project, I conducted a detailed sales analysis for Crust Pizza using Power BI. The goal was to uncover key business insights through interactive dashboards and DAX measures. I worked with cleaned sales data to model relationships, build visuals, and generate insights that support data-driven decisions.

Key highlights of the project:

Calculated total orders and total revenue using DAX measures.

Identified the highest-priced pizza and most popular pizza size.

Created a top 5 pizza types chart based on order quantity.

Analyzed order distribution by hour to find peak sales periods.

Calculated the average pizzas ordered per day to understand daily trends.

Highlighted the top 3 revenue-generating pizzas and their % revenue contribution.

Built a cumulative revenue over time visual to show growth.

Segmented sales by category to find the top 3 best-sellers in each.

This project demonstrates my ability to use Power BI, data modeling, and DAX to extract actionable insights and present them through clear, interactive visual reports.
